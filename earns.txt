so.....
first start a python shell environment for a project by running
pipenv shell

then
install django in pipenv shelll by running
pipenv install django

then starting a  django project by 
django-admin startproject DesireNameOfProject

inside there's a manage.py file that helps with the interaction to django like RUNNING THE SERVER, STARTING AN APP, DATABASE MIGRATION

RUNNING THE DEV SERVER  
python manage.py runserver <optional port>

DEFAULT MIGRATION
python manage.py migrate

STARTING A DJANGO APP INSIDE A DJANGO project
python manage.py startproject DesireNameOfProject

MVC CONCEPT
Creating a class models something like database object meh, DataBase Models...

and thenn
registering the app in settings.py by 'nameOfApp.apps.nameOfAppConfig'

if we already had model..
we can create the database tables for it by running the migrate function

MAKE DATABASE MIGRATION FOR EVERY MODELS
python manage.py makemigrations nameOfApp

then it will automatically migrate the models...
